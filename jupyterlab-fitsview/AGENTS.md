# JupyterLab Extension Development

This guide provides coding standards and best practices for developing JupyterLab extensions. Follow these rules to align with community standards and keep your extension maintainable.

**Extension type**: Document widget with server extension (for viewing FITS astronomical data files)

## External Documentation and Resources

### PRIORITY RESOURCE USAGE

**When you encounter uncertainty, incomplete information, or need implementation examples, you MUST consult these external resources FIRST before attempting to implement features.**

Use your available tools (web search, documentation search) to access and retrieve content from these resources when:

- You're unsure about API usage, method signatures, or interface requirements
- You need to verify the correct approach for a feature or pattern
- You're looking for existing implementation examples or best practices
- You're debugging unexpected behavior and need official documentation
- You're implementing a feature that likely exists in core JupyterLab or other extensions

### Required External Resources

**These resources are PRIORITY references. Always check them when you need external information:**

1. **JupyterLab Extension Developer Guide**
   - URL: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extension/extension_dev.html
   - Use for: Extension patterns, architecture overview, development workflow, and best practices
   - **Action**: Use web search or documentation tools to retrieve specific sections when needed

2. **JupyterLab API Reference (Frontend)**
   - URL: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html
   - Use for: Complete API reference for all JupyterLab frontend packages, interfaces, classes, and methods
   - **Action**: Search for specific APIs when you need method signatures, interface definitions, or class documentation. For example, search "JupyterLab IRenderMime.IRenderer" or "JupyterLab ICommandPalette"

3. **JupyterLab Extension Examples Repository**
   - URL: https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples
   - Use for: Working code examples, implementation patterns, complete working extensions
   - **Action**: Search this repository for similar features before implementing from scratch

4. **JupyterLab Core Repository**
   - URL: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab
   - Use for: Reference implementations in `packages/` directory - all core packages are extensions themselves
   - **Action**: When implementing complex features, search this repo for how core extensions solve similar problems

5. **Project-Specific Documentation**
   - Locations: `README.md`, `RELEASE.md` in project root; check for `docs/` directory
   - Use for: Project requirements, specific configuration, custom conventions
   - **Action**: Read these files at the start of work and reference when making architectural decisions

### When to Use These Resources

**ALWAYS consult external documentation when:**

- ❗ You're about to implement a feature without knowing if there's an established pattern
- ❗ An API call or method isn't working as expected
- ❗ You need to understand the correct lifecycle methods or hooks
- ❗ You're uncertain about type definitions or interfaces
- ❗ You're implementing something that seems like it should be a common pattern

**HOW to access these resources:**

- 🔍 Use web search tools with specific queries like: "JupyterLab IRenderMime.IRenderer interface documentation"
- 🔍 Search GitHub repositories for code examples: "JupyterLab extension examples widget"
- 🔍 Retrieve documentation pages to read API specifications and usage guidelines
- 🔍 Look for working code in the extension-examples repository before writing custom implementations

**Remember:** These resources contain the authoritative information. Don't guess at API usage - look it up!

## Code Quality Rules

### Logging and Debugging

**❌ Don't**: Use `console.log()`
**✅ Do**: Use structured logging or user-facing notifications

```typescript
// In TypeScript files like src/index.ts
import { INotification } from '@jupyterlab/apputils';
app.commands.notifyCommandChanged();
```

**✅ Do**: Use `console.error()` to log low-level error details that should not be presented to users in the UI
**✅ Do**: Use `console.warn()` to log non-optimal conditions, e.g. an unexpected response from an external API that's been successfully handled.

### Type Safety

**✅ Do**: Define explicit interfaces (see example patterns in `src/index.ts`)

```typescript
interface PluginConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  apiEndpoint: string;
}
```

**❌ Don't**: Use the `any` type in TypeScript files
**✅ Do**: Prefer typeguards over type casts

### File-Scoped Validation

After editing TypeScript files, run:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit src/index.ts  # Check single file
npx tsc --noEmit               # Check all files
```

After editing Python files:

```bash
python -m py_compile fitsview/__init__.py  # Check single file for syntax errors
```

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions

**TypeScript/JavaScript** (in `src/*.ts` files):

- **✅ Do**: Use consistent casing
  - Classes/interfaces: `MyPanelWidget`, `PluginConfig`
  - Functions/variables: `activatePlugin()`, `buttonCount`
  - Constants: `PLUGIN_ID`, `COMMAND_ID`
- **✅ Do**: Use 2-space indentation (Prettier default)
- **❌ Don't**: Use lowercase_snake_case or inconsistent formatting

### Documentation

**✅ Do**: Add JSDoc for TypeScript

```typescript
/**
 * Activates the extension plugin.
 * @param app - JupyterLab application instance
 */
function activate(app: JupyterFrontEnd): void {}
```

**❌ Don't**: Leave complex logic undocumented or use vague names like `MyRouteHandler` — prefer `DataUploadRouteHandler`

### Code Organization

**✅ Do**: Implement features completely or not at all. Notify the prompter if you're unable to completely implement a feature.

**❌ Don't**: Leave TODO comments or dead code in committed files

## Project Structure and Naming

### Package Naming

**NPM package** (in `package.json`):

- **✅ Do**: Use lowercase with dashes: `"jupyterlab-myext"` or scoped `"@org/myext"`

### Plugin and Command IDs

**✅ Do**: Define plugin ID in `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
const PLUGIN_ID = 'fitsview:plugin';
```

**✅ Do**: For extensions with multiple commands, create a `src/commands.ts` module to centralize command definitions:

```typescript
// src/commands.ts
import { JupyterFrontEnd } from '@jupyterlab/application';
import { ReadonlyPartialJSONObject } from '@lumino/coreutils';

// Command IDs
export namespace CommandIDs {
  export const openPanel = 'fitsview:open-panel';
  export const refreshData = 'fitsview:refresh-data';
}

// Command argument types
export namespace CommandArguments {
  export interface IOpenPanel {
    filePath?: string;
  }

  export interface IRefreshData {
    force?: boolean;
  }
}

/**
 * Register all commands with the application command registry.
 * Call this function in your plugin's activate function.
 */
export function registerCommands(app: JupyterFrontEnd): void {
  // Register the openPanel command
  app.commands.addCommand(CommandIDs.openPanel, {
    label: 'Open Panel',
    caption: 'Open the extension panel',
    execute: (args: ReadonlyPartialJSONObject) => {
      const typedArgs = args as CommandArguments.IOpenPanel;
      // Implementation using typedArgs.filePath
    }
  });

  // Register the refreshData command
  app.commands.addCommand(CommandIDs.refreshData, {
    label: 'Refresh Data',
    execute: (args: ReadonlyPartialJSONObject) => {
      const typedArgs = args as CommandArguments.IRefreshData;
      // Implementation using typedArgs.force
    }
  });
}
```

Then in `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import {
  JupyterFrontEnd,
  JupyterFrontEndPlugin
} from '@jupyterlab/application';
import { registerCommands, CommandIDs, CommandArguments } from './commands';

const plugin: JupyterFrontEndPlugin<void> = {
  id: 'fitsview:plugin',
  autoStart: true,
  activate: (app: JupyterFrontEnd) => {
    // Register all commands with JupyterLab's command registry
    registerCommands(app);

    // Commands are now registered and can be executed anywhere:
    // - From the command palette
    // - From menus
    // - Programmatically via app.commands.execute()

    // ... rest of activation (e.g., add to palette, create widgets, etc.)
  }
};

export default plugin;
```

**Executing commands with typed arguments:**

```typescript
import { CommandIDs, CommandArguments } from './commands';

// Execute with typed arguments
await app.commands.execute(CommandIDs.openPanel, {
  filePath: '/path/to/file'
} as CommandArguments.IOpenPanel);

// Execute without arguments
await app.commands.execute(CommandIDs.refreshData);
```

**Notes:**

- Accept `ReadonlyPartialJSONObject` in the execute function signature (required by Lumino)
- Cast to your typed interface inside the function for type safety
- Use namespaces (`CommandIDs`, `CommandArguments`) to organize related constants and types
- This pattern matches how popular extensions like `jupyterlab-git` handle commands

**✅ Do**: For simple extensions with 1-2 commands, you can define them directly in `src/index.ts`

**❌ Don't**: Use generic IDs like `'mycommand'` or mix casing styles

### File Organization

**✅ Do**: Organize related files into directories and name by their purpose

- Widget components: `src/widgets/DataPanel.tsx` (class `DataPanel`)
- Command definitions (for multiple commands): `src/commands.ts` with `COMMANDS` mapping
- API utilities: `src/api.ts` (not `src/utils.ts`)
- Frontend logic: `src/` directory

**❌ Don't**: Create catch-all files or directories like `utils.ts` or `helpers.py` or `handlers.py` — partition by feature instead

## Development Workflow

### Environment Activation (CRITICAL)

**Before ANY command**, ensure you're in the correct environment:

```bash
# For conda/mamba/micromamba (replace `conda` with `mamba` or `micromamba` depending on the prompter's preferred tool):
conda activate <environment-name>

# For venv:
source <path-to-venv>/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
<path-to-venv>\Scripts\activate.bat # On Windows
```

**All `jlpm`, `pip`, and `jupyter` commands MUST run within the activated environment.**

**Symptoms of running outside the environment:**

- `jlpm: command not found`
- Extension not appearing after build
- `jupyter: command not found`

**✅ Do**: Always activate your environment first
**❌ Don't**: Run commands in your base/system environment

---

### Complete Development Workflow Checklist

**When implementing a new feature from scratch, follow this complete sequence:**

1. **Activate environment** (see above — required first!)
2. **Write the code** (TypeScript in `src/`, styles in `style/`)
3. **Install dependencies** (if you added any to `package.json`):
   ```bash
   jlpm install
   ```
4. **Build the extension**:
   ```bash
   jlpm build
   ```
5. **Install the extension** (REQUIRED for JupyterLab to recognize it):
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
   ```
6. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   jupyter labextension list  # Should show your extension as "enabled" and "OK"
   ```
7. **Start JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
8. **Test the feature** in your browser

**Critical: Steps 5-7 are REQUIRED after building. Building alone is not enough!**

---

### Understanding Build vs Install

Many issues arise from confusing these two steps:

#### `jlpm build` — Compiles the Extension. Do this every time you change TypeScript code.

- **What it does**: Compiles TypeScript → JavaScript, bundles the extension
- **Output**: Creates files in `lib/` and `fitsview/labextension/`
- **What it does NOT do**: Register the extension with JupyterLab

#### `pip install -e .` + `jupyter labextension develop .` — Registers the Extension. Do this once as a setup step.

- **What it does**: Tells JupyterLab where to find your extension
- **Output**: Creates symlinks so changes are reflected
- **Result**: Extension appears in JupyterLab

**You need BOTH steps!** Building prepares the code; installing registers it with JupyterLab.

**Common mistake**: Running only `jlpm build` and expecting the extension to appear. It won't show up until you also run the installation commands.

---

### Initial Setup (run once)

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
```

### Iterative Development

**Development with auto-rebuild** (recommended):

```bash
jlpm run watch                      # Auto-rebuild on file changes (keep running)
# In another terminal:
jupyter lab
```

**After editing TypeScript** (files in `src/`):

- If using `jlpm run watch`: Just **refresh your browser** (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
- If not using watch: Run `jlpm build`, then **refresh your browser**

**Quick TypeScript validation** (optional, for fast feedback):

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit src/index.ts       # Check single file
```

**Memory aid**: "What did you change? Restart that!"

- Changed **JavaScript** → Build (or auto-builds with watch) → **Refresh browser**
- Changed **Python** → **Restart JupyterLab server** (no build needed)

### Debugging and Diagnostics

```bash
jupyter labextension list           # Check if extension is installed

jlpm run lint                # Lint frontend code
```

**Browser console** (ask user to check):

- Request user to open browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
- Ask user to report any JavaScript errors
- Ask user to check for failed network requests
- Ask user if the extension appears to be loaded

---

### Troubleshooting: Extension Not Appearing

If your extension doesn't appear in JupyterLab after building:

**1. Check if the extension is installed:**

```bash
jupyter labextension list
```

Your extension should appear as **"enabled"** and **"OK"**.

**2. If NOT in the list**, run the installation commands:

```bash
pip install -e .
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
```

**3. Did you restart JupyterLab?**

- Changes require a full restart (Ctrl+C in terminal, then `jupyter lab` again)
- Simply refreshing the browser is NOT enough for new extensions

**4. Ask user to check the browser console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I):

- Request user to look for JavaScript errors that might prevent extension activation
- Ask user to search for the extension ID (`fitsview`) to see if it loaded
- Ask user to report any error messages or warnings

**5. Verify the build output:**

```bash
ls -la lib/                          # Should contain compiled .js files
ls -la fitsview/labextension/  # Should contain bundled extension
```

**6. If still not working**, try a clean rebuild following the reset instructions below

**Common causes:**

- ❌ Only ran `jlpm build` without installation commands
- ❌ Forgot to restart JupyterLab after installation
- ❌ Running commands outside the activated environment
- ❌ Build errors that were missed (check terminal output)

### Reset (if build state is broken)

```bash
jlpm clean:all       # Clean build artifacts
# git clean -fdX     # (Optional) Remove all ignored files including node_modules
jlpm install         # Only needed if you used 'git clean -fdX'
jlpm build
pip install -e ".[dev]"
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
```

### Environment Notes

**✅ Do**: Use a virtual environment (conda/mamba/micromamba/venv)
**✅ Do**: Use `jlpm` exclusively
**❌ Don't**: Mix package managers (`npm`, `yarn`) with `jlpm`
**❌ Don't**: Mix lockfiles — keep only `yarn.lock`, not `package-lock.json`

## Best Practices

### Project Structure Alignment

**✅ Do**: Follow the template structure

- Keep configuration files in project root: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `tsconfig.json`
- Frontend code: `src/index.ts` and other `src/` files
- Styles: `style/index.css`

**❌ Don't**: Rename or move core files without updating all references in configuration

### Version Management

**✅ Do**: Update version in `package.json` only

- The `package.json` version is the source of truth
- `pyproject.toml` automatically syncs from `package.json` via `hatch-nodejs-version`
- Follow semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

**❌ Don't**: Manually edit version in `pyproject.toml` — it's dynamically sourced from `package.json`

**Note**: Releases are handled by GitHub Actions, not manually. AI agents should only update versions when explicitly requested by the user.

### Development Approach

**✅ Do**: Start simple and iterate

- Begin with minimal functionality (e.g., a single command or widget)
- Test in running JupyterLab frequently
- Ask user to check browser console for errors

**❌ Don't**: Build complex features without incremental testing

## Common Pitfalls

### Package Management

**✅ Do**: Use `jlpm` consistently

```bash
jlpm install
jlpm build
```

**❌ Don't**: Mix package managers or lockfiles

- Don't use `package-lock.json` (this project uses `yarn.lock`)
- Don't run `npm install`

### Path Handling

**✅ Do**: Use relative imports in TypeScript (`src/` files)

```typescript
import { MyWidget } from './widgets/MyWidget';
```

**❌ Don't**: Use absolute paths or assume specific directory structures

### Error Handling

**✅ Do**: Wrap async operations in try-catch (in `src/api.ts`, widget code)

```typescript
try {
  const data = await fetchData();
} catch (err) {
  showErrorMessage('Failed to fetch data');
}
```

**❌ Don't**: Let errors propagate silently or crash the extension

### CSS and Styling

**✅ Do**: Namespace all CSS in `style/index.css`

```css
.jp-fitsview-widget {
  padding: 8px;
}
```

**❌ Don't**: Use generic class names like `.widget` or `.button`

### Resource Cleanup

**✅ Do**: Dispose resources in widget `dispose()` methods

```typescript
dispose(): void {
  this._signal.disconnect();
  super.dispose();
}
```

**❌ Don't**: Leave event listeners or signal connections active after disposal

## Quick Reference

### Key Identifiers

Use these patterns consistently throughout your code:

- **Plugin ID** (in `src/index.ts`): `'fitsview:plugin'`
- **Command IDs** (in `src/commands.ts` or `src/index.ts`): `'fitsview:command-name'`
  - For multiple commands, create `src/commands.ts` with a centralized `COMMANDS` mapping
  - For 1-2 commands, define directly in `src/index.ts`
- **CSS classes** (in `style/index.css`): `.jp-fitsview-ClassName`

### Essential Commands

See [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) section for full command reference.

## Viewarr (Rust/WASM Image Viewer)

This package lives in the `viewarr` monorepo. The `viewarr/` directory here is a **symlink to
the single shared `../viewarr`** copy at the repo root (not a submodule, not a private copy). It
is a Rust/WASM image viewer built with egui that compiles to WebAssembly and is bundled into the
JupyterLab extension. The same shared `viewarr/pkg/` is consumed by `pyviewarr`, so a viewarr
change affects both packages — build and test both before committing, and a single release ships
the new viewarr into both (see the root `README.md` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

### Building Viewarr

**ALWAYS use the npm scripts in the viewarr package to build WASM:**

```bash
cd viewarr
npm run build         # Release build (optimized)
npm run build:dev     # Debug build (faster compilation, includes debug info)
```

**❌ Don't**: Run `wasm-pack` directly — the npm scripts handle the wrapper bundling step that copies the JavaScript wrapper files into `pkg/`.

### What the Build Does

1. Compiles Rust to WebAssembly via `wasm-pack`
2. Copies the JavaScript wrapper (`js/index.js`) to `pkg/wrapper.js`
3. Updates `pkg/package.json` to point to the wrapper as the entry point

### After Modifying Viewarr

After making changes to Rust code in `viewarr/src/`:

```bash
cd viewarr && npm run build   # Rebuild WASM
cd .. && jlpm install         # Copy updated WASM to node_modules (REQUIRED!)
jlpm build                    # Rebuild JupyterLab extension to bundle new WASM
```

Then refresh JupyterLab in the browser (or restart if needed).

**⚠️ Important:** The `jlpm install` step is critical! Webpack reads from `node_modules/viewarr/`, not directly from `viewarr/pkg/`. Without this step, the old WASM will be bundled even after rebuilding.
